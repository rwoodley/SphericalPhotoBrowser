To Do:

Make Droste spiral
Change width of Droste so there is more space in the middle group.
Control where square droste goes.

Ideas for future dance performances:
- Close to camera. 
- Around camera. Walk around camera!
- Bright colors.
- Steady lighting.
- Have people emerge from a door and run around the camera to the other side of the room. looks good on torus.

To Do for proposal
------------------
- add ability to add N meshes at various sizes and positions and textures. 
So they can all have different geometries and complex transforms.
- Add new texture based on camera looking at a scene. 
- put animated figure in scene. create exhibition proposal.

- mediaUtils handles camera and video controls as now.
- transformUtils has a list of uniformsEditor. when the editor needs to run
it swaps in the uniforms it needs to edit.
- uniformsEditor handles uniforms.
    we need multiple uniformsEditors for the animation loop.
- for now transformUtils only works on default uniforms.


TODO:
- get tracking and recording working.
- add back in old modes 
- rename mesh manager.
- get mirror ball working in new framework. get sky dome working in new framework.
- enable Paul's partial ball.
- allow same video on multiple spheres. different videos on multiple spheres.
- allow left-click on effects.
