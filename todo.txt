To Do:

Make Droste spiral
Change width of Droste so there is more space in the middle group.
Control where square droste goes.

Ideas for future dance performances:
- Close to camera. 
- Around camera. Walk around camera!
- Bright colors.
- Steady lighting.
- Have people emerge from a door and run around the camera to the other side of the room. looks good on torus.

To Do for proposal
------------------
- add ability to add N meshes at various sizes and positions and textures. 
So they can all have different geometries and complex transforms.
- Add new texture based on camera looking at a scene. 
- put animated figure in scene. create exhibition proposal.

- mediaUtils handles camera and video controls as now.
- transformUtils has a list of uniformsEditor. when the editor needs to run
it swaps in the uniforms it needs to edit.
- uniformsEditor handles uniforms.
    we need multiple uniformsEditors for the animation loop.
- for now transformUtils only works on default uniforms.

- put back in capture code.
        // if (that.capturer != undefined && that.mediaUtils.animationFrame%120 == 0)
        if (that.capturer != undefined){
            var recording_fps = 60;
            timing = that.capturer.getTiming();
            actual_fps = timing.performancetime - that.lasttiming.performancetime;
            ratio = actual_fps / recording_fps;
            // playbackRate is normalised
            that.mediaUtils.video.playbackRate = ratio;
            that.lasttiming = timing;

            that.capturer.capture( that.canvas );
        }
- put back in video restart code:
    this.mediaUtils.postProcessingAfterVideoRestart = function() {
        if (that.currentUniforms.enableTracking.value == 1)
            that.trackerUtils.reset();        
    }
    this.mediaUtils.postProcessingAfterVideoLoad = function(pid) {
        // Load stills for this video if they exist.
        var pathToSubtractionTexture = 'media/' + pid + 'Still1.png';
        (new THREE.TextureLoader()).load(pathToSubtractionTexture, function ( texture ) {
            mediaUtils.setMipMapOptions(texture);
            that.currentUniforms.iChannelStillMask1.value =  texture; 
        });
        var pathToSubtractionTexture = 'media/' + pid + 'Still2.png';
        (new THREE.TextureLoader()).load(pathToSubtractionTexture, function ( texture ) {
            mediaUtils.setMipMapOptions(texture);
            that.currentUniforms.iChannelStillMask2.value =  texture; 
        });        
    }

TODO:
- see above
- add back in old modes
- DEBUG:
    - why aren't mobius rotations working?
    - "Change geometries" aint working, at least with multiple meshes.
- rename mesh manager.
- get mirror ball working in new framework. get sky dome working in new framework.
