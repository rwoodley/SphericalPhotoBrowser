Put your JPGs and MP4s that you get from your Ricoh Theta into the /media directory.

Then run the script 'refreshMediaIndex.sh' to build an index of the photos and vides you just added.

You have to serve the site. You can't browse to it from the file system. So run this command:

   `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

And browse to http://0.0.0.0:8000

That's it.

Hit the space bar to toggle visbility of icons.
